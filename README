The purpose of this code is to test the context switch cost from VM to another VM.

step 1:

2 VMs will be created on the VM sharing the same pCPU.

A busy loop on VM1 will exit to Hypervisor, to yeild the pCPU to VM2. The VM2 will busy loop some time and yeild back to VM1. Then we check the check the cost of the switch.

step 2:
Increase to 4 VMs.
